                Installation Instructions for the RMON2 Agent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software Requirements

    To compile the RMON2 agent, you will need:

	* GNU C Compiler (gcc), no version in special, but consider using
	  a recent one (2.95.3 or newer).  The agent can be compiled on a
	  gcc-3.2.3 with no problems.

	* Make utillity, such as GNU Make (make).

	* GNU Debugger (gdb), if available.

	* Packet Capture library (0.7.1 or newer), which you can obtain at:
	    http://www.tcpdump.org/

	* Net-SNMP (5.0 and 5.1 series, others won't work), which you can obtain
	  at:
	    http://www.net-snmp.org/

	* RMON2-MIB and TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB files, available at:
	http://www.simpleweb.org/ietf/mibs/modules/IETF/txt/RMON2-MIB
	http://www.simpleweb.org/ietf/mibs/modules/IETF/txt/TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB

	* The RMON2 Agent source (which you already have) ;)

	* Not exactly software, but you need superuser privileges to monitor
	  networks.



How to Install

    0	First, ensure you have a Net-SNMP with dlmod support, or the RMON2 agent
	will not be loaded, and you'll have to recompile Net-SNMP.  This is done
	like follows:

	    # snmpd -H

	This will generate a long listing of supported tokens.  The bad news is
	that you'll have to scroll through those lines searching for:

	    dlmod                    module-name module-path


    1	Compile it:

	    $ cd ramon-<version>
	    $ make

    	In case of errors, please send the full output of the make process
	to us so we can fix the errors and help you.  Contact information is
	available in the README file, under 'Getting in Touch With Us'.

	It is possible to get architeture-specific optimizations if you're using
	gcc-3.x (or above) series by issuing:

	    $ make arch=athlon-tbird

	This instructs Make to include additional optimizations when compiling
	the agent, in the example, enabling AMD Athlon Thunderbird processor
	specific optimizations.  Why would you like to care about this?  Because
	this can dramatically reduce CPU usage.  The hash function, for example,
	can execute up to 4x (four times!) faster on an Athlon Thunderbird.

	The magic consists in passing to gcc an additional parameter (-march),
	which you inform when set `arch' to one of these values (extracted from
	gcc man page):

	    i386, i486, i586, i686, pentium, pentium-mmx, pentiumpro, pentium2,
	    pentium3, pentium4, k6, k6-2, k6-3, athlon, athlon-tbird, athlon-4,
	    athlon-xp, athlon-mp


    2	Install it:

	    $ su
	    (your superuser password)
	    # make install

	In most cases, you wouldn't want to allow non-superuser users to
	launch the agent.  If you *really* need to allow users to launch
	the agent, then use this install method:

	    # groupadd rmon2	(the group which will have permission)
	    # make install.suid

	Then change the supplementary group of the authorized users, adding
	this new group 'rmon2'.  You can change the group by editing the
	Makefile, and changing the value of the SUID_GRP variable.


    3	Edit Net-SNMP snmpd.conf file:

	Usually, the snmpd.conf file is located under /usr/local/share/snmp
	or /usr/share/snmp.

	Open it for editing with your preferred application and add the
	following line to the end of the file:

	    dlmod  rmon2 /usr/lib/rmon2.so

	In the case you've modified the Makefile to change the default
	installation directory, you need to supply the correct path to the
	rmon2.so library.


    4	Install MIB files:

	Download the MIB files:
	http://www.simpleweb.org/ietf/mibs/modules/IETF/txt/RMON2-MIB
	http://www.simpleweb.org/ietf/mibs/modules/IETF/txt/TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB

	And copy them to Net-SNMP mibs directory, usually /usr/share/snmp/mibs
	or /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs:

	    # cp RMON2-MIB /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/
	    # cp TOKEN-RING-RMON /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/


    5	Launch Net-SNMP snmpd as usual:

	Logged in as a privileged user (superuser or belonging to the
	authorized group set in step 4), start snmpd, like follows:

	    # snmpd

	Please have a look at the snmpd log file, to check for any errors
	that might had happened, usually under /var/log/snmpd.log:

	    # cat /var/log/snmpd.log


    6	Create some network traffic and request full RMON2 output:

	If you use Net-SNMP command-line tools:

	    $ export MIBS=+RMON2-MIB
	    $ snmpwalk -c <your_community> <host_to_query> rmon

	The exported shell environment variable instructs the tool to also
	look at the RMON2-MIB file and thus provide readable textual output.

	If an error occurs, please refer to ERRORS file for instructions.


    7	Finished! :)
