==============================================================================
                         Error Handling Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 major error classes for this RMON2 agent:

    1 Compile and/or installation errors
    2 Runtime errors (better known as 'crashes')
    3 Unknown errors



1 Dealing with Compile and/or Installation Errors

    You launched 'make', 'make install' or 'make install.suid' and an error
    message appeared.  We need to see a detailed make output.

    First, let's clean things up:

	$ make distclean

    Then let's repeat the build process, but saving all output to a file you
    should send to us:

	$ make -d &> make-step1.log

    Now please send us an e-mail with this file attached.  Contact info is
    available in the README file, under 'Getting in Touch With Us' section
    (at the end of the file).

    We will analyse the file and try to detect/reproduce the errors, and will
    return to you as soon as possible.  If the error is complex, we will make
    a first contact, indicating that we are working on it, and then a second
    contact when solved.



2 Dealing with Runtime Errors (Crashes)

    Compilation and installation processes were successful, but the agent
    crashes.

    We will need to rebuild the agent with debugging information included. If
    the agent crashed during a SNMP requisition, we will issue it again to
    catch where the agent is crashing.

    First, clean up with:

	$ make distclean

    Then, recompile using:

	$ make debug=yes &> make-step2.log

    Install as described in the INSTALL file (either using 'make intall' or
    'make install.suid').

    Now it's time to start the Net-SNMP daemon again, but this time it will be
    inside GNU Debugger, and cannot be done by users except the superuser:

	# gdb `which snmpd`

    We also need to tell Net-SNMP snmpd to not run as a daemon, as follows:

	(gdb) set args -f

    And finally launch:

	(gdb> run

    If the RMON2 agent crashed during a SNMP request (snmpget, snmpset,
    snmpwalk, ...), then repeat this request as you did before.  When the
    agent crashes, proceed as follows:

	(gdb) bt full

    And then send us this output, and, if a SNMP requisition was made, details
    about what you were trying to get (eg: the group you were accessing, the
    type of access (get, walk, set)).  With these details we can reproduce the
    situation and then fix the agent.



3 Dealing with Unknown Errors

    Yes, these are the most difficult to catch, reproduce and fix.

    We will need the outputs generated by both steps 1 and 2, described above,
    and some more info as:

	* gcc version
	    $ gcc --version

	* gdb version
	    $ gdb --version

	* bin-utils version
	    $ ld --version

	* glibc version (if Linux)
	    $ ls /lib/libc-*

	* Kernel version
	    $ uname -a

	* Packet Capture library version

	* Net-SNMP version

	* Tips, such as:
	    * Was there network traffic?
	    * Was there any SNMP request sent?

	* Any additional information that might be useful, such as CPU info,
	  endianess, memory, etc.

    It is very likely that we will ask additional information, depending on
    the problem's nature.
