                            What is this software?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is an extension to the Net-SNMP agent, providing statistics of high-layer
network protocols, in conformance to the RMON2 MIB (Remote Network Monitoring
Version 2 Management Information Base), standardized by the IETF (Internet
Engineering Task Force) in 1997.  It is based on a previous work done by Lúcio
Braga, finished in 2001 when he got his Masters degree in Computer Science.

To do this, the RMON2 agent captures packets in the network with the help of
packet capture library (libpcap), and then analyses the packet's headers in
order to populate RMON2 MIB.


Design Limitations:
    * Able to decode only IPv4 over Ethernet packets, which use TCP or
      UDP as the transport protocol
    * Currently, SNMP SET operations are not handled

Performance Limitations:
    * Hosted on an 1.7GHz i686, it's expected to cope with network traffic
      rate of about 52,000pps (packets per second), with average packet length
      of 256 bytes.

Althought the agent is capable of running in a shared environment (e.g, a
'normal' multi-user station), it currently needs a good amount of CPU time.
We are working hard to address these limitations, so the agent can be hosted
on less powered stations, or really share resources of fast stations.
